# CHATTY APP

Chatty App is a web application that allows you to chat with other users. You can chat with them anonymously or you can select a username for yourself and change it. Your name will have its own color, so you can distinguish between your messages and others'. You can also see how many people are online at a moment.

## GETTING STARTED

1. Create a new folder for the project and clone the project.
2. Using the terminal, install all the client side dependencies with the command `npm install <package>` in the project folder.
3. Run the command `npm start` in project's folder.
4. Open another tab on your terminal and go to the `chatty_server` folder, which is also in the project's folder.
5. Install all the server side dependencies with the command `npm install <package>` (in the `chatty_server` folder).
6. Run the command `npm start` (in the `chatty_server` folder).
